````
use enmrelease;
select * from version;
````

The version can be also verified at http://localhost:8080/enanomapper/admin/database

####Deployment

- Deploy the [enanomapper.war](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ambit/files/Ambit2/AMBIT%20REST%20web%20services/custom%20releases/enanomapper) in your Tomcat instance.

- Open the following URI in your browser, replacing YOURHOST and YOURPORT with the relevant values from your configuration.

````
http://YOURHOST:YOURPORT/enanomapper/dataset
````

- The browser should then display the dataset page (empty).

	Scheme=jdbc\:mysql
	Port=3306
	Database=enmrelease
	User=guest
	Password=guest
````

#####Customize the Web application authentication and authorization
